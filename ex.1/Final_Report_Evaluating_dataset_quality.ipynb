    "Target Imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable pet_has_active_subscription had a mild imbalance (~60/40 split).\n",
    "\n",
    "This finding led to the use of SMOTE and TomekLinks in Exercise 2 to balance the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dominant Food Preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "61% of pets did not consume wet food (ate_wet_food_pre_tails = 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "87% of pets consumed premium dry food.\n",
    "\n",
    "These were identified as highly important features for predicting subscription activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavioral Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Features like total_web_sessions, total_web_sessions_since_last_order, and total_minutes_on_website were consistently higher among subscribed pets.\n",
    "\n",
    "These behavioral indicators later guided the creation of interaction features (e.g., total_engagement) in Exercise 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phik Matrix Correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "total_order_kcal, neutered, and web activity features showed strong non-linear correlations with the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-correlation features like signup_promo and pet_allergen_list were later dropped during variable selection in Exercise 3.\n"

    "\n",
    "fuel_consumption was highly right-skewed and had extreme outliers.\n",
