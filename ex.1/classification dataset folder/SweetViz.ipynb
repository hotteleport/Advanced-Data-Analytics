    "o 61% of pets (7,981) have never ordered wet food (value = 0).\n",
    "o 39% of pets (5,106) have placed at least one wet food order (value = 1).\n",
    "o This indicates that wet food adoption is relatively low, presenting a strong opportunity for growth in this category.\n",
    "2.\tActive Subscription Status (pet_has_active_subscription)\n",
    "o 60.4% of pets (7,907) have an active subscription (value = 1).\n",
    "o 39.6% (5,180) do not have an active subscription (value = 0).\n",
    "o This suggests that a large portion of customers are not currently engaged with recurring services.\n",
    "3.\tPet Food Tier (pet_food_tier)\n",
    "o 77.4% of pets (10,131) are in Tier 1 (value = 1), likely representing premium or full-service plans.\n",

    "5.\tPet Favourite Flavour List (pet_fav_flavour_list)\n",
    "o 58% of pets (7,591) have no recorded flavour preference (value = 0).\n",
